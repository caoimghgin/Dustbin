# Dustbin
Cleans up desktop. Moves and organizes files by date to your home directory.

If you're a messy marvin (like me) it doesn't take long for your desktop to fill up with files and folders as you're working. Rather than stopping everything and make careful choices of what to organize and what to delete, simply run Dustbin. Everything will be moved into your home directory and organized by date. Now your desktop is clean and you can keep working without worrying about deleting anything you might need in the future.

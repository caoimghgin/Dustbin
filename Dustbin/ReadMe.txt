This is a great project for learning obj-c basics. Right now, I'm figuring out how to use GIT and seeing what a branch does. I'll save this and merge and see if that does anything.

Using version GitHub v1.2.3, I have finally figured out how to use Git version control. The previous version was buggy. I could even work in Git under command line but I prefer a GUI solution. xCode integrates tightly with Git repositories and provides an excellent FileMerge utility so the user can see what changes are going to happen before he commits.
